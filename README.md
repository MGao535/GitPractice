Ever since the "big" cryptocurrency boom a few years ago that saw Bitcoin soar in price only to come back down to the ground, cryptocurrency and support for different IPO/ICO have only increased. Many different coins have risen and fallen while others have steadily increased ever since their inception. One coin that has steadily grown is Ethereum. Not only is it worked on by many different companies, but public support for it seems to have only increased. This article is especially interesting, however, because it talks about how Ethereum wants to essentially pave the way into Web 3.0, which is something we talked about in class. I think that if this does pan out then it'll be a truly amazing development but also potentially worrying because of how new everything will be. With Ethereum becoming the "world computer" the entire internet might change as a result, but if it'll be a positive change with less corporate censorship/filtering or if it'll just lead to more of the companies that are working on Ethereum developing a stronger hold on the internet we use everyday. This potential for a huge change might even cause conflict, which puts this project in a very interesting spotlight.
